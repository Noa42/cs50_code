I used the following query: SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
In this way I can get the average value of energy, valence and danceability columns from the songs table.
The results are the following:
-Average energy: 0.65906
-Average valence: 0.484443
-Average danceability: 0.71646
So I would say 2018's aura is mery energetic and makes you wanna dance.
As an alternative I would calculate the aura from different playlists so teh resultas can be more consistent accordint to the listeners's moods.
