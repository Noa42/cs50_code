Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Some teams had no chance at all of winning the world cup. With higher number of simulations they get some chance but low.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I would say that the results did not change that much after 1000 simulations, but the running time gets quite higher after that. So I would say that 1000 simulations is quite an optimum number.
